ClazzJS
=======

ClazzJS is portable JavaScript library for class-style OOP programming. It's main goal to provide expressive DSL to
write your JavaScript programs in easy-to-understand, well-known, convenient and flexible clazz base manner. It's works
well both on client and server sides.

Features include:
- Single inheritance
- Expressive, extensible DSL for declaring your class with constants, methods, properties, events and so on.
- Event emitting
- Object properties changes observing
- Namespaces

You'll find some examples bellow to have a common idea what i'm talking about.

**Caution:** This library is still under development. I don't think that it's API will be changed much. But you must take this into considiration.
